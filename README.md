# searchWebsiteAPI

The public API used in the development of this webpage in no longer operational, however I have included the code as it was when I submited it as a university project to highlight my web development ability. The webpage allowed users to search for items in a database, and dynamically displayed the data in a user-friendly manner. The search functionality no longer works due to the API used no longer being operational, however the link to the website is:

http://jc1467.brighton.domains/web_assignment1/index.html

The webpage consists of a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file.
